# ExifGPS
Haskell code for extracting Exif data from JPEG files, including GPS location information

The code uses the Haskell Bytestring libraries to inspect the raw binary data in the JPEG files, and follows the JPEG and EXIF specs (which are included in the repository) to extract the data.

Note that the code requires a lot more documentation
